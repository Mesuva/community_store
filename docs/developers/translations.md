# Translations

Interface translations for Community Store are managed at [translate.concrete5.org](https://translate.concrete5.org/translate/package/community_store).
This is the same translation system used for concrete5 add-ons in the official marketplace, meaning that you can visit `/index.php/dashboard/system/basics/multilingual/update` within your concrete5 installation to download and install/update the most up-to-date translation. 

To provide translations, please register/login at the above link.

In the past, translations have been directly stored alongside the project. If you are starting a new translation on translate.concrete5.org, you may find that existing translations at [https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/tree/master/languages](https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/tree/master/languages) provide a good starting point.
