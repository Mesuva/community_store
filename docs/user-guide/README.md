# Introduction
 
Community Store is a free and open-source online shop/cart add-on for the PHP based content management system [concrete5](https://www.concrete5.org/).

The add-on includes common online shop components such as a shopping cart, product lists, a checkout mechanism and ways to track orders. It is not a stand-alone system - it integrates tightly with concrete5, with blocks and pages used to present products.

There is a 'core' Community Store package, which can then be expanded with further add-ons. Therefore the [concrete5-community-store organisation](https://github.com/concrete5-community-store) contains multiple projects.


## Key Features

## Goals

Community Store aims to be a highly configurable eCommerce solution for concrete5. 

Whilst it has sensible defaults and styling using concrete5's default theme Elemental, it aims to be as free as possible of its own styling - allowing it to be styled and customized freely to match a custom theme.

Another goal is to provide shop components that can take full advantage of concrete5's strengths. For example, products or lists of products as blocks which allows for advanced permissioning, layouts and easy template overriding. There is also support for member creation and adding users to groups on the purchase of products, which then combined with concrete5's broader permissioning powerfully handles the control of pay-online content. 

On a technical level, Community Store aims to follow concrete5's 'best practices' and coding conventions. 

 
 
## Documentation Scope

The aim of this documentation is not to cover every feature of Community Store in depth. Instead, it aims to cover concepts that are not immediately obvious, or developer concepts such as overriding templates and developing new shipping and payment methods.
